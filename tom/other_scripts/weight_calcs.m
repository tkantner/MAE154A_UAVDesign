%MAE 154A Preliminary Weight Calculations

%This script uses randomly generated parameters to determine designs that meet
%our specs. It uses an xls (Excel) file known as 'Engine_Database.xlsx'
%to pull data about engines, and uses a function called getEngineWeight to
%determine the weight from this database. Results are saved to a xls file
%called 'Valid_Designs.xls'
